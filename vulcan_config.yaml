For addtional details on individual inputs, see the 'Inputs of the Plot Configuration Interface' section of Vulcan's 'Help'-page documentation OR dittoSeq's own documentation. Any inputs without an exact label match within that Vulcan 'Help'-page table will map directly to some dittoSeq input for the function with the same name as your chosen plot type. You can find dittoSeq's documentation from either within R itself, run `?dittoSeq::<visualization-name>`, or from the RDRR.io page that pops up when you google the package."
